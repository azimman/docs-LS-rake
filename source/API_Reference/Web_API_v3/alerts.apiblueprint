Alerts allow you to specify an email address to receive notifications regarding your email usage or statistics.
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Usage alerts allow you to set the threshold at which an alert will be sent. For example, if you want to be notified when you've used 90% of your current package's allotted emails, you would set the "percentage" parameter to 90.</li>
  <li>Stats notifications allow you to set how frequently you would like to receive email statistics reports. For example, if you want to receive your stats notifications every day, simply set the "frequency" parameter to "daily". Stats notifications include data such as how many emails you sent each day, in addition to other email events such as bounces, drops, unsubscribes, etc.</li>
</ul>
