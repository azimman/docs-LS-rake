<p>SendGrid offers a Web API that allows customers to retrieve information about their account such as statistics, bounces, spam reports, unsubscribes, and other information. This API is not RESTful since for most calls both GET and POST HTTP verbs can be used interchangeably, and other verbs are not supported.</p>
