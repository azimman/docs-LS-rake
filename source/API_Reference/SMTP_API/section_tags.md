Section tags are similar to [substitution tags]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/SMTP_API/substitution_tags.html) in how they're built, but are specific to the message, not the recipient. You have to have a substitution tag value for **each** recipient, but you can have any number of section tags. Section tags can then contain Substitution tags for the recipient if needed. Section tags have to be contained within a Substitution tag, since SendGrid needs to know which data to populate for the recipient.
See the [Section Tag Example Walkthrough](#-Section-Tag-Example-Walkthrough) below.

It's possible & acceptable to use only Substition tags. However, that method is not [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), and you may come against [message size limitations]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Build/Add_Content/whats_the_recommended_message_size_limit.html).

The format of the SMTP API section tag has the form:
{% codeblock lang:json %}
{
  "section": {
    ":sectionName1": "section 1 text",
    ":sectionName2": "section 2 text"
  }
}
{% endcodeblock %}

{% info %}
How you flag your section tags may depend on the library you use to create your SMTP connection, the language you are writing your code in, or any intermediate mail servers that your servers will send mail through. In some cases `-subVal-` may be the best choice while in other cases, `%subVal%`, `#subVal#`, or `:subVal` may make more sense. The flag doesn't matter, as long as it's a unique string.
{% endinfo %}

{% warning %}
Do not use spaces inside your section or substitution tags! e.g. `%first name%`
The space breaks the string.
