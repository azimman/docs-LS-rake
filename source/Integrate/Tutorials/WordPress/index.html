SendGrid’s WordPress plugin replaces WordPress’s default <strong>wp_mail()</strong> function by using either an SMTP or API integration with SendGrid to send outgoing email from your WordPress installation. It also allows you to upload contacts directly to your SendGrid <a href="{{root_url}}/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/index.html">Marketing Campaigns</a> account via the <a href="{{root_url}}/Integrate/Tutorials/WordPress/subscription_widget.html">SendGrid Subscription Widget</a>.

By using the SendGrid plugin, you will be able to take advantage of improved deliverability and an expanded feature set, including tracking and analytics, to enhance user engagement on your WordPress installation. SendGrid also provides <a href="https://support.sendgrid.com/hc/en-us">world class customer support</a>, should you run into any issues.

SendGrid’s WordPress Subscription Widget makes it easy for people visiting your WordPress site to subscribe to your marketing emails, such as any newsletters, announcements, or promotional offers you may send. Upon signup, they’ll receive an opt-in email allowing them to confirm their desire to begin receiving your emails. This confirmation constitutes “double opt-in,” a deliverability best practice.
