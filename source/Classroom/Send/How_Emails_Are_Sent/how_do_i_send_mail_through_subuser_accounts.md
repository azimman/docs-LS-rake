All you need to do to send mail through a Subuser account is to simply **use that subuser accountâ€™s credentials to send mail via SMTP or API** rather than the parent account credentials. Subusers can also log into [sendgrid.com](http://sendgrid.com/) to take advantage of the [SendGrid Marketing Campaigns]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/index.html) tool to send campaigns to stored lists via the online user interface.
