Next question.

 

In all seriousness, we don't allow our users to send to purchased lists for any reason. 

First, purchased lists violate our [Email Policy](https://sendgrid.com/email_policy).

Second, it's just bad practice and sending to one will only end in tears. You can find out more [here]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Deliver/Address_Lists/why_purchased_email_lists_are_no_good.html).
