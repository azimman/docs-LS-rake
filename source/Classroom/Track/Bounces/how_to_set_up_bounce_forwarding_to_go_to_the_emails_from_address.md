You can receive bounce notifications to a specific address by enabling the "Forward Bounces" feature in your account and defining the forwarding address. However, you can also set it to send any bounces back to the originating FROM address.

To access this feature navigate to **[Mail Settings](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/mail_settings)** --> **Forward Bounce**


From there, toggle the slider to "on", then leave the "Use the from address" box ticked and the email address entry field blank. This setup allows you to receive a bounce notification report to the FROM address on the email that bounced.
