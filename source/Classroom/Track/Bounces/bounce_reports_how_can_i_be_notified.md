If you want to receive notification of [bounces](http://app.sendgrid.com/bounces) in your application, you can enable the [Real-time Event Notification API](http://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Webhooks/event.html) and SendGrid will alert your application of any bounces, clicks, opens, or otherwise that happen to the emails you send. Alternatively, you can enable [Bounce Forwarding](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/mail_settings) within your account to receive an email each time a bounce occurs.

You can also retrieve and edit your list of bounces through our [Web API.](http://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API/bounces.html)
