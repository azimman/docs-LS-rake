Your SMTP username and password is the same username and password you provided when you signed up for SendGrid. We use the same set of credentials as the default for the website access and SMTP authentication.

SendGrid also allows you to create multiple sets of credentials for your account. You can create a set of credentials for **sending mail**, and/or **website + API** access, or any combination of the two. [You can set up and manage your credentials here.](http://app.sendgrid.com/settings/credentials)
