Trying to upgrade and seeing this message? There are a couple of reasons you might see this. 

 

**Outstanding payment** - You may have an outstanding balance remaining on your account. We prevent accounts from upgrading further until these kind of issues are cleared up. Be sure to check your [Billing History](https://sendgrid.com/billing) to see if any invoices are unpaid. If this is the case, you can [resubmit payment]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Basics/Billing/update_your_credit_card_and_resubmit_payments.html) directly from the site. 

 

**Account Suspension** - Our compliance team may have your account under review, this status also prevents further upgrading until everything has been resolved. [Read more here]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Troubleshooting/Account_Administration/account_under_review_suspended.html) about what to do in this case.
