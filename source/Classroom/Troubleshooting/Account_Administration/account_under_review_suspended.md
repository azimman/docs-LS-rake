SendGrid reviews accounts that appear to have abnormal activity in order to preserve your reputation as a sender. We apologize for any interruption in your service. The quickest way to reactivating your account is to respond directly to the ticket sent to the email address associated with your SendGrid account.

The impacts on your account are explained below:

**Warning** : The account maintains full functionality for the duration of the review process. However if we do not receive a response your account may be suspended to prevent risk to your reputation.  
  
**Suspension** : SendGrid will accept and queue mail while the account is under review. Mail will be held until issues are resolved or up to 72 hours from the time of send. If mail is queued for over 72 hours from send, it will expire and not be delivered. _ **\*\*** Please be aware that an account in a suspended state will continue to incur auto-renewal billing for your subscription. **\*\*** _

**Deactivation** : SendGrid will not accept mail while an account is deactivated. Once deactivated, any undelivered mail that has been queued on SendGridâ€™s systems will be deleted. While the account is deactivated, click and open tracking links will be disabled. _ **\*\*** Please be aware that an account in a deactivated state will continue to incur auto-renewal billing for your subscription. **\*\*** _

**Ban** : All access to the account is blocked. Email requests to our system will not be accepted. If an account has dedicated IP's these will be removed. Related sub-users will also be banned and unable to send email or access their account._ **\*\*** Please be aware that an account in a banned state will stop any auto-renewal billing, though you will still be charged for any overages or newsletter usage used during your final month. **\*\*** _  
  
**Reactivation** : When issues are resolved, SendGrid will reactivate your service. At which point, your account will be restored and queued messages will be delivered. Happy times.

 

If you receive a warning, suspension, deactivation, or ban notice from SendGrid, please respond to questions asked in the email notice. The quickest way to reactivate your account is to respond directly to the ticket sent to your email address.
