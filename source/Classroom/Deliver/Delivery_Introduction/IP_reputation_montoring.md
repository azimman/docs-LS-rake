As it turns out, SendGrid does not offer dedicated IP address reputation monitoring as a service.  We do not manage the reputation of your dedicated IP address since only your mail is being sent via your dedicated IP. This means that you have ultimate control over the content that is being sent out and therefore are responsible for monitoring and maintaining its reputation and listing status. However, there are many services that can help you maintain your IPâ€™s reputation. 

The following are some third party tools available to assist you in maintaining your reputation:

* [250ok](https://250ok.com/tools/blacklists/)
* [Return Path](https://returnpath.com/request-a-demo-social/?sfdc=701000000006Za6&gclid=CIO88sevkcwCFRSPfgod6u8AXA)
* [Sender Score](https://www.senderscore.org/blacklistlookup/)

In addition, SendGrid does offer [Delivery Consultation](https://sendgrid.com/marketing/delivery-consult/) services to Pro and Premier accounts that can help with deliverability and on-boarding. Services include how to maintain/improve domain and IP reputation, reviewing message content, dedicated IP configuration, and creating a custom IP warm-up plan just to name a few.
