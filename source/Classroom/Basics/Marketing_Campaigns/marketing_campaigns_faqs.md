{% anchor h3 %}
Are stats included for email I send via SMTPAPI and the Web API?
{% endanchor %}

No, these stats are specific to the email you send over Marketing Campaigns only.

{% anchor h3 %}
How do I find stats for a specific campaign?
{% endanchor %}

You can go into the settings menu after your campaign has started sending, and there will be a link for “Stats”.

{% anchor h3 %}
Is there a way for me to get more stats than are shown on the UI?
{% endanchor %}

You can always export a CSV of raw stats for any of your campaigns. That will include stats like CTR, total open rates, spam report rate, and more.
