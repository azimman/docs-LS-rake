We do not offer a true "sandbox" environment, however we do have a [Free plan](https://sendgrid.com/transactional-email/pricing) which allows you to send 12000 emails per month, and also gives you access to almost all of the features offered with our higher package levels. The Free plan does not include access to a dedicated IP or IP whitelabeling.

We also have a [sink email address]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Troubleshooting/Delivery_Issues/safely_test_your_sending_speed.html) that can help you test message throughput for your integration.
