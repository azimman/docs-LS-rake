Legacy Newsletter usage is charged at a rate of **$0.25 per 1000 messages** that are sent using either the Legacy Newsletter UI or API suite. This charge is in addition to normal monthly plan charges and any overage charges you may incur from the previous month.

 

If you find yourself being charged for using both Legacy Newsletter and Marketing Campaigns, consider one of the following options: 

**1.** (Recommended) Move your marketing email over to our Marketing Campaigns platform. This removes the per email usage fee that you incur when using Legacy Newsletter, and instead uses a contact storage based pricing model.

**2.** Continue to use the Legacy Newsletter, and delete your contacts you have stored in Marketing Campaigns. This removes the per/10k storage charge from the equation. Please keep in mind when choosing this option that **Legacy Newsletter will eventually be deprecated**. 

_Please note that lists, content, and features ARE NOT SHARED between Legacy Newsletter and Marketing Campaigns, so you will need to settle on using one feature set or the other if you wish to avoid being billed for both._
