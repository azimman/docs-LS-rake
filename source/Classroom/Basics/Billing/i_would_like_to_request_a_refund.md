 You must meet both criteria below in order for a refund to be considered:

**You have not used your account in the current calendar month** 

Sendgrid packages operate off of a monthly subscription model, not direct usage. We will not issue a refund if you have used your account in the same calendar month as your request. Instead please cancel your account to avoid any future subscription charges.

EXAMPLE:

If you request a refund on the 5th of the month, but have used your account on any of the previous days in that month (1st - 5th), we cannot issue a refund. 

Alternatively, if you request a refund on the 5th of the month, and we can see that your account was not used during the current month, we can begin the discussion of issuing a refund. 

Please note; Refunds are only applicable to the subscription charge on your account, not for overages accrued during the prior month or contact storage charges.

**You have no overages and/or have no contacts stored in Marketing Campaigns**

Refunds are only applicable to the subscription charge on your account, not for overage or contact storage charges from the prior month. We hold our customers responsible for managing their account credit limits and contact storage.

EXAMPLE:

If you request a refund on your $79.95/mo Pro account, and your monthly invoice totals $117.00 due to a combination of overages and contact storage, you are only eligible for a refund of up to 79.95.The remaining 37.05 cannot be refunded in this scenario.


For more information on how overages are calculated, please refer to the above graphic, or visit our [pricing page](https://sendgrid.com/pricing).

Did you forget to downgrade or cancel your account? [Click here for more info]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Basics/Billing/forgot_to_cancel_or_upgrade.html). 

 

If you meet all of above conditions, please respond directly to the invoice email you have received, or email [billing@sendgrid.com](mailto:billing@sendgrid.com) to begin the discussion about a possible refund.
