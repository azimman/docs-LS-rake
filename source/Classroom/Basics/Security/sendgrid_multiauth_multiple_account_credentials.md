[**SendGrid MultiAuth**](https://app.sendgrid.com/multifactor/configure) allows you to create multiple sets of credentials associated with your SendGrid account. These secondary credentials are used to send email, use our APIs, and access your account's online portal. There are three different "rights" you can assign to the credentials and you can use any combination of the three.

**Email** - The ability to send email via SMTP Relay or using the [Send Mail function of the Web API v3](http://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Mail/index.html)

**API** - The ability to interact with your account through all [SendGrid APIs]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Basics/API/what_are_the_sendgrid_apis_and_what_do_they_do.html) excluding the Send Mail function of the Web API

**Web** - Access to your account's SendGrid portal. This includes all aspect of the login portal including account settings and billing information
