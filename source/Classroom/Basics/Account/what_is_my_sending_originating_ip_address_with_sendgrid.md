# Do I have a dedicated IP?

Depending on the plan you have chosen, you either have a dedicated sending IP address or you are using a shared sending IP address.

- All Pro+ customers are given dedicated sending IPs.  
- Free, [Legacy Lite]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Basics/Billing/legacy_lite_plan.html), and Essential customers all share sending IP addresses.

# One IP

You can find your accountâ€™s main IP address on your Account Overview page. It is towards the bottom on the left hand side.
