We're sorry to see anyone leave, but things happen and we totally understand. If you want to cancel your account, you can [do it here](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/billing). 

Cancellations take full effect on the first day of the next calendar month, at which point your account will still be usable, but will be at the Free package level.  

 

We wish you the best of luck in your future email endeavors,  we'll always have Paris. <3
