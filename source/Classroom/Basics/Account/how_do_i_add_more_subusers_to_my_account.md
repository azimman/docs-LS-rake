By default, we limit the amount of subusers a Pro (or higher) account has to a maximum of 15. If you find yourself needing more than 15, please use the request form on the [Subuser Management](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/subusers) page, and we can help you get more added. The form will only become available once you have reached the limit of 15 created subusers. 

We will ask a few questions about what you will be using subusers for, and the volume you might be sending over them. Don't worry though, we're only asking so we can help you have the best experience possible with your new subusers. 

Read more about what subusers are, and what features they have  [here]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Basics/Account/what_are_subusers.html).
