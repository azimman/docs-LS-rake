{% info %}
Accounts are currently limited to 2500 campaigns.
{% endinfo %}

When you are ready to send an email campaign, go to the campaigns page and click “Create Campaign.” From here you will be able to choose the template to use for this campaign, add content, and send the email.

{% anchor h2 %}
Choose Your Template
{% endanchor %}

{% info %}
You can also create a campaign from your <a href="{{root_url}}/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/templates.html">templates list</a>.
{% endinfo %}

We have provided you with multiple default templates to choose from. If you decide to upload your own email design we suggest that you <a href="{{root_url}}/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/templates.html">create a template</a> so that you can reuse it.

{% warning %}
The importer will not save your template for later use.
{% endwarning %}

We have also included a Paste HTML option, just click the "Paste HTML" tab, where you can paste your HTML in for one-time use in this campaign.

{% anchor h2 %}
Add Your Content and Manage Your Settings
{% endanchor %}

{% info %}
The editor will autosave your changes every 2 minutes. That way, if you close your browser window your changes will be saved.
{% endinfo %}

Once you choose your template, you will be taken to the campaign editor page.

From here you can change the content in your email without affecting your template, meaning that any changes here will be saved for this campaign only and will not change your template. This allows you to use the same template multiple times without having to worry about changes from campaign to campaign. As you make changes to your campaign, you will notice the “Save” button change to “Saving…” as the editor autosaves your changes.

<strong>Campaign Name:</strong> This is the name of your campaign, so you can find it again from the campaigns page. Newly created campaigns are named "Untitled" unless you specify a name. You are not required to give your campaign a unique name.

{% warning %}
Your <a href="{{root_url}}/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/senders.html">sender identity</a> must be verified before you use it to send a campaign.
{% endwarning %}
<p>
<strong>From Sender:</strong> This is the person from whom this email will be sent. The user will see this name as the sender on their email.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Email Subject:</strong> The subject line the user will see. Note: You can use substitution tags in order to personalize the email subject for your customers.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Email Preheader:</strong> You can write a brief description of the content of your campaign. This preheader text will appear direcly after the subject line when a recipient previews your email. The preheader is one of the very first items that a user will see when viewing your campaign. This setting allows you to easily create a unique preheader without having to make any changes to your template.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Lists/Segments to Send To:</strong> You can choose which contacts will receive your email. You can choose more than one list or segment. A contact in multiple selected lists will only receive the email once.
</p>

{% warning %}
When you schedule a campaign, the sender identity used will not be able to be deleted.
{% endwarning %}
<p>
<strong>Send Immediately/Schedule:</strong> You can set when this email will be sent to your contacts. “Send Immediately” is selected by default. If you would like to schedule your campaign, click the “On” button to toggle the custom schedule options. Scheduled campaigns will be scheduled only after you click "Schedule" in the upper right hand corner. Remember, your timezone is set in your <a href="https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/account.html">account settings</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Categories:</strong> This is a category that you can set for your emails, which will help you track delivery metrics in the SendGrid advanced statistics section based on your own classifications of the emails you are sending. To add a category, type the name and press enter.
</p>

{% info %}
You can create up to 10 different categories.
{% endinfo %}

<p>
<strong>Unsubscribe Group:</strong> This allows you to select which unsubscribe group to apply to this campaign so that users who have already opted out of these emails do not receive them again. In order to keep your sender rating high, it is important to make sure that you don't send emails to users who have already unsubscribed. To create a new unsubscribe group, please go to the <a href="https://app.sendgrid.com/suppressions/advanced_suppression_manager">Unsubscribe Groups</a> page. For more information, please see our <a href="{{root_url}}/User_Guide/Suppressions/index.html">Suppressions documentation</a>.
</p>

<p>
You can also choose to use your own custom unsubscribe group, by selecting “Use Custom Link…” from the group dropdown menu and inserting a URL into the text field that appears.

<img src="{{root_url}}/images/unsubscribe_group_dropdown.png" alt="Unsubscribe Group Dropdown Menue" />
</p>

{% info %}
In order to send or schedule a campaign, an [unsubscribe] tag is required in both the plain text and HTML versions of your content, and a corresponding unsubscribe group or custom URL must be selected.
{% endinfo %}

<p>
<strong>IP Pool:</strong> If you have created one or more IP Pools, an extra dropdown menu will be displayed that gives you the option to select an IP Pool for use with your currently selected campaign. For more information about IP Pools and how they may be helpful, please see our <a href="{{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/IP_Management/ip_pools.html">IP Pooling Documentation</a>.

<img src="{{root_url}}/images/ip_pool_dropdown.png" alt="IP Pool Dropdown Menue" />
</p>

{% warning %}
The test send will be deducted from your email package limit.
{% endwarning %}

{% info %}
This test email will not replace your substitution tags, as you will be sending to an email address and not to a formal contact in your database.
{% endinfo %}

<strong>Send Test Email:</strong> If you want to see the email as your customer would see it, you can enter your email address here and click “Send.” The campaign will be sent to the email specified immediately.

{% info %}
To send a test email to more than one address, simply separate each address with a comma. You can send test emails to no more than 10 different addresses.
{% endinfo %}

{% info %}
Don't forget that you can use <a href="{{root_url}}/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/templates.html#-Replacement-Tags">replacement tags</a> for both a weblink and unsubscribe links.
{% endinfo %}

{% anchor h2 %}
A/B Testing Your Campaigns
{% endanchor %}

If you want to test the subject or content of your campaigns before you send it, check out our <a href="{{root_url}}/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/Campaigns/a_b_testing.html">A/B Testing Guide.</a>

{% anchor h2 %}
Preview Your Campaign
{% endanchor %}

<p>
It is good practice to look at your campaign on a couple of different screen sizes. In order to expedite this process for you, we have provided a desktop and mobile preview for you. At the top of your screen you will notice three icons that look like the following:

<img src="{{root_url}}/images/templates_8.png" alt="Desktop Preview" /> is the desktop preview option. It will show you what your users will see when looking at your email through their desktop email application.

<img src="{{root_url}}/images/templates_9.png" alt="Mobile Preview" /> is the mobile preview option. It will show you what your users will see when looking at your email through a mobile email application.

<img src="{{root_url}}/images/templates_10.png" alt="Text Preview" /> is the text preview option, also known as plain text. It will show you what text-only users and screen readers will see when they look at your email.
</p>

<p>
You may also preview any campaign listed on the Campaigns page. Simply click the Action Cog next to the campaign you would like to preview, and select Preview. You will be shown a small window displaying both mobile, and desktop, formats.
<br />
<img src="{{root_url}}/images/campaign_dropdown_preview.png" />
<br />
<img src="{{root_url}}/images/campaign_preview_modal.png" />
</p>

{% info %}
While the preview functionality we provide will cover many use cases, it will not render the same on all mobile devices or desktop email clients. We recommend you use programs like <a href="https://litmus.com/">Litmus</a> to check that your email renders appropriately across all devices and clients.
{% endinfo %}

{% anchor h2 %}
Save or Send Your Campaign
{% endanchor %}

{% info %}
You cannot resend a campaign once it has been sent!
{% endinfo %}

{% warning %}
Your <a href="{{root_url}}/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/senders.html">sender identity</a> must be verified before you use it to send a campaign.
{% endwarning %}

You have the option to save your campaign, for editing later. Once you are ready to send, you can click the “send” button in the top right corner of this page. If you have chosen to schedule your campaign, it will be sent at the time specified. If you do not schedule your campaign, it will send immediately.

{% anchor h2 %}
View All of Your Campaigns
{% endanchor %}

From the campaigns page, you can view all the campaigns that you have built or sent. High level statistics about each campaign will be available in-line with the name, send date, and status of the campaign. You can also click the gear icon at the right to duplicate, view stats, or preview the campaign.

{% anchor h2 %}
Search Your Campaigns
{% endanchor %}

<p>
  As you create and send more campaigns, it can become difficult to find older campaigns, either to view their statistics or to reuse content for a new campaign.
</p>

<p>
  From the campaigns page, simply type a campaign name or any word or words that would be in the campaign name into the search bar.
</p>

<p>
  <img src="{{root_url}}/images/campaigns_search.png" alt="Search Campaigns" />
</p>

<p>
  All campaigns with names containing the searched word or words will be returned, with up to 10 search results displayed per page. You may select search results to delete or export by checking the box on the left, or you can edit a campaign by opening the Action Cog menu as you normally would from the campaigns index. You may also return to the campaigns index at any time, either by clicking Campaigns in the navigation menu on the left, or by clearing the search box.
</p>

<p>
  You may also filter your results by status: "All", "Draft", "Scheduled", "In Progress", "Sent", or "Canceled."
</p>

{% anchor h2 %}
Duplicating a Campaign
{% endanchor %}

To duplicate a campaign that you already have, just click the gear icon to the right of that campaign and choose "duplicate". You will be taken to the campaign builder where you can change the name from the default auto-generated and timestamped campaign name. This will automatically create this campaign in your list, even if you do not click the "save" button.

{% anchor h2 %}
Unschedule a Campaign
{% endanchor %}

From the main campaigns page, you can click the gear icon inline with your campaign and select "Unschedule Campaign". This will put your campaign back into a draft status and remove the schedule date.

{% anchor h2 %}
Campaign Statistics
{% endanchor %}

<p>
Once you have sent a campaign, you can click the gear icon next to the campaign name and then choose “stats.” From here, you will get statistics specific to this campaign including bounces, clicks, opens, etc. and you can also export a CSV with the raw stats.
</p>

<img src="{{root_url}}/images/stats_1.jpg" alt="Campaign Statistics" />

<p>
You can choose to see either raw numbers or percentages when looking at your campaign statistics by clicking the Toggle switch on the Campaigns page.
</p>

{% anchor h3 %}
Exporting Statistics for Multiple Campaigns
{% endanchor %}

<p>
You can export a CSV containing the statistics for multiple campaigns. This exported CSV will closely resemble the CSV exported for a single campaign’s statistics, with the exception of two additional columns containing the campaign name and ID for each row of statistics. These columns will be labeled “Campaign Name” and “Campaign ID”, respectively.
</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <img src="{{root_url}}/images/bulk_edit_button.png" class="img-responsive pull-left"/>
  </div>
  <div class="clearfix col-md-8">
    <p>
    To export statistics for multiple campaigns, navigate to your Campaigns page within Marketing Campaigns. Check the box next to each campaign that you want to include in your stats CSV. As you add campaigns, you will notice a number on the bulk dropdown menu in the upper right increase.
    </p>
  </div>

<ul>
  <li>Campaigns are ordered from most to least recent.</li>
  <li>The CSV will include a row for each day that SendGrid has gathered statistics.</li>
  <li>Every stats CSV that you export will contain a row containing the totals for each column.</li>
</ul>

{% anchor h3 %}
Link Tracking
{% endanchor %}

You can also view detailed statistics about the links you include in your campaigns. From your Campaign Statistics page you will see a table ranking your links according to the number of times they were clicked by your recipients. You will see the number of total clicks for each link in addition to the total number of unique clicks for each link. All of these stats can be displayed as raw numbers or percentages by clicking the Toggle switch.

{% info %}
Click tracking stats will be displayed for the top 20 most frequently clicked links within your campaign.
{% endinfo %}

<img src="{{root_url}}/images/link_tracking.png" alt="Link Tracking" />

Create a Segment Based On Your Engagement Metrics
{% endanchor %}

<p>
  Marketing Campaigns makes it very easy to create a dynamic segment of recipients who have either opened one of your campaigns or have clicked links within a campaign.
</p>

<p>
  First, from either the <strong>campaigns list view</strong> or the individual <strong>campaign stats page</strong>, hover over the "Unique Opens" or "Unique Clicks" stats.
</p>

<p>
  <i>From the campaigns list view:</i>
  <img src="{{root_url}}/images/campaign_stats_2.png" alt="View Details" />
</p>

<p>
  <i>From the individual campaign stats page:</i>
  <img src="{{root_url}}/images/campaign_stats_1.png" alt="View Details" />
</p>

<p>
  Click <strong>View Details</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  This will present you with a real-time list of all recipients who either opened your campaign, or clicked a link within your campaign (depending on the particular metric you selected).
</p>

<p>
  Next, click <strong>Create Segment</strong>. This will open a segmentation window. By default, the segment will contain the conditions to capture all recipients who either opened your campaign or clicked within your campaign. The segment will be given the name “Contacts who [clicked/opened] [your campaign name].”
</p>

<p>
  You can rename this segment or modify the conditions of the segment as you wish directly in this window. For more information on segmentation, click <a href="{{root_url}}/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/lists.html#-Create-a-Segment">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <img src="{{root_url}}/images/campaign_stats_4.png" alt="View Details" />
</p>

<p>
  Once you're done creating your segment, click <strong>Save</strong>. You now have a dynamic segment that will continuously update as recipients engage with this campaign.
</p>

{% anchor h3 %}
Export a List of Engaged Recipients
{% endanchor %}

<p>
  In addition to creating a dynamic segment of recipients based on campaign engagement as described above, you can also export a list of all contacts who have either opened your campaign or have clicked a link within your campaign (up until that moment).
</p>

<p>
  Simply hover over either the "Unique Opens" or "Unique Clicks" stats of the campaign that you're interested in. Then click <strong>View Details</strong>. Finally, click <strong>Export CSV</strong>.
