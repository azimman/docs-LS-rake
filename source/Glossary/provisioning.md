Provisioning is SendGrid’s process for validating all of our customers before we let them on our network. Since it is our company mission to make it as easy as possible for a developer or marketer to send emails and make sure they get delivered, we have to protect our network and your name from spammers. However, if you are in provisioning, this does NOT mean that we think you are a spammer. It just means that we are looking you up and verifying that you are who you say you are. We don’t want spammers to use your name or our network to do what they do.

By verifying domain ownership, evaluating every website, and determining what kind of messages will be sent, (and who they will be sent to) we maintain our credibility as an email provider and also help you get the best deliverability possible. These additional checks are part of what separates us as white hat senders in the industry.

How long will this take?
{% endanchor %}

Sometimes provisioning may take a little longer because a member of our experienced support team will perform our verification process. This protects you, as a customer, and it protects our other customers by making sure that we don’t let nefarious people on our network.

What can I do in the meantime?
{% endanchor %}

Our Provisioning Team will be sending you a few emails that may contain some requests for additional information. Please answer any questions to the best of your ability so we can get you sending as quickly as possible!
