Not to be confused with the post-send email events like [clicks]({{root_url}}/Glossary/clicks.html), [drops]({{root_url}}/Glossary/drops.html), or [bounces]({{root_url}}/Glossary/bounces.html) that SendGrid tracks: in terms of [automated email]({{root_url}}/Glossary/automated_email.html), **triggering events** are events that you specify based on the ways that your users interact with your website or application. These events can be tracked and used to prompt a [triggered action]({{root_url}}/Glossary/triggered_actions.html), such as the delivery of an email.

Viewing a webpage, using a feature, clicking a button, or buying a product are all examples of events that can be used to determine when an email should be sent and what the content of that email should be.

Events that are tracked through [Threads](http://threads.io/) may also have properties that can tell you more about what happened: the address of the webpage your user visited, the exact button they clicked, or the plan type they purchased.
